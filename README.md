# Map, Image, Emoji


## Workshop 

Title: Let's Make Emoji Maps!
With: Joey Lee (tw: @leejoeyk)

About: 
Let's Make Emoji Maps! Emojis are an expressive (and fun) means of representing emotions and actions as well as physical features. There's plenty of great examples of people using emojis in maps like the Emoji Weather Maps (https://blog.darksky.net/emoji-maps/) or the Emoji Atlas (https://twitter.com/emojiatlas?lang=de), all of which use emojis as a way to symbolize various things in geography. In this workshop, we will use emoji mapping as a way to explore some new ways of representing space as well as some concepts around data processing (e.g. pixel matching!). 

This workshop will be a fun evening of tweaking code and creating emoji maps that mean something different for each of us. I'd ❤️ to 👀 you!

# Setup

## Materials

If you're reading this, then you've found all the materials you need for the workshop!

## A quick note on browsers

### Chrome

* things should work fine here without any fiddling. 

### Firefox

* Note if you are using firefox, you will have to disable hardware acceleration to get your emoji's to show up. You can find out more here. 
* to disable: preferences > general > performance: uncheck "use hardware acceleration when possible"

## A simple webserver

* There's a bunch of ways to get a webserver running in your machine. 
* I'd suggest:

On mac:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

or any platform that can run Node.js, use the `http-server` npm module:

```
# install the module
npm install http-server -g

# run, user the --cors flag in case you get cross-origin issues
http-server 

# check http://127.0.0.1:8080 
```
